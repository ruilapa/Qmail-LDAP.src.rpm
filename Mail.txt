Well it's been a long time since I have written to this ML, and
I think it's time some people in this ML take it to the next step in the chain of evolution.

So, I decided it was time I contribute something to you guys who helped me,
but especially, with a BIG token of gratitude to,
   Claudio Jeker and Andr√© Oppermann ( "THE GUYS" ).

About 2 years ago I started developing rpm packages to do the job I many times did:
   - get packages, get patches, get init's, compile, install, tweak

So, after a stable time, I decided it was time to return them to the comunity.

Built packages:

- qmail-ldap
- qmail-ldap-config

Independent Documentation package, install on your PC, not on server:
- qmail-ldap-doc

Most used Daemons:
- qmail-ldap-pop3d
- qmail-ldap-qmqpd
- qmail-ldap-qmtpd
- qmail-ldap-smtpd
- qmail-ldap-pbsdbd

Basic binc imap:
- qmail-ldap-imapd-binc
- qmail-ldap-imapd-binc-ssl

Basic courier-imap 3.x:
- qmail-ldap-imapd-courier
...

In return:
- Don't bother Claudio or Andre about this
- Don't ask basic questions
- Don't ask questions without console logs, and a detailed explanation of what you have done
- Contribute changes
- Hire my time!
